  <h1>Preface</h1>
  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>In order to be an effective programmer, one must have a firm grasp on one of the most basic technologies used in computer science: algorithms. The autodidact surely teaches himself to grapple with algorithms. However, one can not expect that algorithms do not move beyond <i>FizzBuzz</i>. The complexity involved in the application and analysis of these tortuous blocks of code is just as capable of evoking anger as they are awe. What follows is a document of my attempt to achieve a firm grasp of this material.</p>
  <h2>Plan</h2>
  <p>The course of this material will run parallel with my endeavor through <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>, by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. The pages that follow are in no way a replication of the text book, but a replication of my notes while slowly making my way through the book. For this reason, I highly recommend that any fastidious reader of this material <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms">purchase or rent</a> this book. It's a fantastic read. For the sake of brevity, I will refer to this book as the <i>CLRS</i>.</p>
  <p>One task that I've taken upon myself is that of translation. Wherever the <i>CLRS</i> has made use of pseudocode, and wherever I choose to show my notes for that material, I've chosen to make that code available in Javascript ES6 and Ruby, as both of these languages pertain to my particular programming efforts. In the future, I might choose to demonstrate this code in other languages, but these two will make for a good start.</p>
  <codebox title="Ex. 1">
    <pre ruby #rubyBlock>
      <code class="ruby">
        class RubyCode
          # See, this is what Ruby looks like!
        end
      </code>
    </pre>
    <pre javascript #javascriptBlock>
      <code class="javascript">
        class JavascriptCode {
          // See, this is what Javascript (ES6) looks like!
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
  </codebox>
  <p>It is my hope that this material will be beneficial for any like-minded individuals. Because there is such a vast amount of information to communicate here, my method of communication will be far from honed. If you recognize any errors in what follows, grammatical or syntactical, please get in contact.</p>
  <h2>This Website</h2>
  <p>I've begun this website with this section on Algorithms. The website itself is built on Angular 2 (before the official release), and I have a long way to go before it looks and acts as it should. For this reason, I will make slow progress on the site as I slowly put up content.</p>
